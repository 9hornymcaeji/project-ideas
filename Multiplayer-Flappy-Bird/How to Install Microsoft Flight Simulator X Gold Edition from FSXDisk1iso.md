Microsoft Flight Simulator X - Gold Edition is a popular simulation video game that lets you experience the thrill of flying different aircrafts in various scenarios and locations. However, installing the game from FSXDisk1iso, a file that contains the first disk of the game, can be tricky. Here are some steps and tips to help you install the game successfully.

[**Download File**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgeags.com%2F2tM7pf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2O66GvDCsQLwTs_m9irnje)

 
1. Download FSXDisk1iso from a reliable source, such as [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/fsxdisk1_201908). This file contains the first disk of the game, which is required for installation. You will also need to download the second disk of the game, which is available from the same source.
2. Mount FSXDisk1iso using a virtual drive software, such as PowerISO or Daemon Tools. This will create a virtual DVD drive on your computer that contains the contents of FSXDisk1iso.
3. Run the setup.exe file from the virtual DVD drive and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter a serial key for the game, which you can find online or use one of these keys: `W6CK9-86K77-6D6FJ-8K339-8P7G6` or `W6CK9-86K77-6D6FJ-8K339-8P7G6`. Note that these keys may not work for online activation, so you may need to use a crack or a patch to bypass it.
4. When prompted to insert Disk 2, mount FSXDisk2iso using another virtual drive software and point the setup to the new drive letter. Alternatively, you can copy both FSXDisk1iso and FSXDisk2iso to a single folder and run the setup from there.
5. Wait for the installation to complete and enjoy the game!

If you encounter any errors or problems during the installation, you can try some of these solutions:

- Download and install vcredist\_x86.exe from [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=26347&6B49FDFB-8E5B-4B07-BC31-15695C5A2143=1). This will install some required components for the game.
- Download and run resetsldl.exe from [flyawaysimulation.com](https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/18934/fsx-resetsldlexe/). This will reset the FSX installer and fix some activation issues.
- Download and install FSX Acceleration from [this link](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:de3bc3ae852681bdf66e4b5eb3d25cf3e11e9a6a&dn=FSX_%20Acceleration.iso%20&tr=udp%3a%2f%2%20ftracker.bitsearch.to%20%3a1337%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2%20ftracker.opentrackr.org%20%3a1337%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2%20fipv4.tracker.harry.lu%20%3a80%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2%20ftracker.moeking.me%20%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2%20ftracker.openbittorrent.com%20%3a80%2fannounce). This will update the game to the latest version and add some new features and missions.
